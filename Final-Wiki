| [Logical Topology Diagram](docs/Logical.png) | Visual representation of logical network segmentation. |
| [Physical Topology Diagram](docs/Physical.png) | Physical layout of network devices and connectivity. |
| [Hosts Inventory](docs/Hosts-Inventory.md) | Inventory of all servers, workstations, and network appliances. |
| [Policies](docs/Policies.md) | Organizational policies and regulatory frameworks to enforce compliance. |
| [Technologies & Software](docs/Technologies-and-Software.md) | Operating systems, applications, and services used across the network. |

## 🛡️ Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

This milestone ensures continuity of operations and organizational resilience through structured backup, restoration, and disaster recovery planning.

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Backup Policy](docs/Backup-Policy.md) | Comprehensive backup strategy including retention periods, backup types, encryption, automation, off-site storage, and the 3-2-1-1-0 rule. |
| [Disaster Recovery Policy](docs/Disaster-Recovery-Policy.md) | Framework covering risk assessment, RTO/RPO definitions, system recovery procedures, and communication plans. |
